My name is Nonye and I am a plant loving iOS Developer from the SF Bay Area! 

During my free time away from my screen I enjoy hiking, spending time with family and friends and finding new places to explore all across the world. Traveling is a major part of my life and I try to escape from my city whenever time allows.

Some of my best skills include Swift, Application Structure, UI/UX and team work!

Best way to contact me and to see more skills/experience I have is through my LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/nonyeeze/
