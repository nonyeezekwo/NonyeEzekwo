My name is Nonye and I am a plant loving iOS Developer from the SF Bay Area! 

During my free time away from my screen I enjoy hiking, spending time with family and friends and finding new places to explore all across the world. Traveling is a major part of my life and I try to escape from my city whenever time allows.

Some of my best skills include Swift, Application Structure, UI and team work!
